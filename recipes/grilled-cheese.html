    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Grilled cheese is the perfect lazy summer dinner. Quick and delicious, you'll be making a second sandwich before you remember how much you didn't feel like cooking.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
